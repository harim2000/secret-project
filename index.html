            <p>Its almost been a whole year since we started talking! Since you know Im all about that data analysis I was wondering what I could find
                using this kind of analysis on the messages we have sent to each other since the start of March.</p>
            <p>I was able to gather all the data from iMessage 💬 (since April 19th 2018) and a small part of the data from Snapchat 👻 (December 14th, 2018)</p>
            <p>(Since I was only able to get since that date for Snapchat, I actually tried to scroll up all the way on Snapchat to see all the messages we have 
                sent to each other and I got up to September when the app actually crashed on me and it wouldnt open up again until I uninstalled and reinstalled Snapchat hehe so just 
                to give you an idea of the magnitude of all the messages we have sent to each other ❤️) </p>
             <p>I made this little website to display the results from the data analysis I did and just a couple more things that I thought of hehe</p>
            <p>So here are some stats that I was able to gather from the data that I got, its not much but I hope you like it. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>❤️ Totals and Misc Stats ❤️</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the totals and averages that I found from the data, both of you, me, and both combined.</p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul class="first">
                <li>Total messages sent: <em>8750 texts</em> <em class='emoji'>💬</em> (over 299 days), <em>3089 Snapchat messages</em> <em class='emoji'>👻</em> (over 58 days), and <em>683 Snaps</em> <em class='emoji'>👻</em> (over 58 days)
                    for a grand total of: <em>12,522 messages</em> sent <em class='emoji'>❤️</em><br>
                    This is really surprising hehe. If we were to text as much as we sent snap messages we would have <em>15,924 texts</em> in the 299 days. 
                    We send Snapchat messages <em>1.8X</em> as much as we do texts</li>
                <br>
                <li>Messages sent by me (Harim): <em>4501 texts</em> <em class='emoji'>💬</em>, <em>1575 Snapchat messages</em> <em class='emoji'>👻</em>, and <em>391 Snapchat Snaps</em> <em class='emoji'>👻</em></li>
                <br>
                <li>Messages sent by you (Betsy): <em>4249 texts</em> <em class='emoji'>💬</em>, <em>1514 Snapchat messages</em> <em class='emoji'>👻</em>, and <em>292 Snapchat Snaps</em> <em class='emoji'>👻</em></li>
                <br>
                <li>Number of images sent: <em>533 pictures</em> sent by the two of us</li>
                <br>
                <li>Number of words sent by me (Harim): <em>51,353 words</em> averaging 11.4 words per message (iMessage only)</li>
                <br>
                <li>Number of words sent by you (Betsy): <em>37,476 words</em> averaging 8.8 words per message (iMessage only)</li>
                <br>
                <li>Took my laptop <em>10.23 minutes</em> to process through the text data and <em>2.23 minutes</em> to process through the Snapchat data &#x1F4BB;</li>
                <br>
                <li>If I were to process the data of how much I love you, however, we would have to wait till the end of time for it to finish processing even 1% of it 
                    <em class="emoji">&#x1F609;&#x1F618;&#x1F498;</em></li>
                <br>
                <li>Day we started saying "I Love You": January 26th at around midnight <em class='emoji'>❤️</em></li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <ul class="second">
                <li>Day with most text messages <em class='emoji'>💬</em>: January 28th, 2019 (389 text messages and 98 snaps (messages and snaps) sent)<br>
                That day I had taken my exam in the morning and then we met up in the afternoon to grab lunch. We went up and down the Ave looking for somewhere 
                to eat (TBH I was just trying to stall and spend more time with you hehe <em class='emoji'>🤫🤭</em>). We ended up going to the Korean BBQ place, you paid for the both 
                of us and then we walked back down the Ave to catch the bus for you to head home. Right before you got on the bus, we hugged and that was the day 
                we shared our first "I love you" in person <em class='emoji'>💓</em>, I just wish that moment would have lasted a bit longer because I felt secure and wonderful in your 
                arms, even as Im typing this up I feel the same feeling as I did back then, a feeling of pure joy, of love, of care. When you got home you took a 
                nap and I went to help a friend with some CS homework (which I used as practice for if you need help with your CS homework in the coming quarters 
                hehe). After you woke up (I had missed you and was waiting for you to wake up to talk to you again hehe) you went and took Oso out for a walk. When 
                you got back we talked about the possibility of my parents coming back and the fear that I had of becoming antisocial and boring again if they did 
                come back. Im so happy to know that I have you to trust in and that youll always be there to help me. (Im just giggling like a little kid remembering 
                all of this hehehe) That night I also told you how when I look at you my mind goes blank and my heart starts racing, like when I was trying to tell 
                you about the episode that Abi hadnt watched yet and how I see my everything when I look at you. I love you so much, Betsy! After that we started 
                playing some games of battleship, which I <em>totally</em> won all of them <em class='emoji'>🤥</em>. I sent you the song 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcJm1pOswfM">"Can't Take My Eyes Off You" by Frankie Valli</a> and you sent me 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ByIYof4mqo">"Open Arms" by Journey</a> and I sent you another song too hehe 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWkQbrfSvfs">"Para tu Amor" by Juanes</a> (I love how we get deep into this loving feeling️️️ <em class='emoji'>❤️</em>)
                Hehe we then talked about the amazing moment we shared with the hug and I compared it to when you said that you would like to wrap me in a "gazillion 
                red hearts and ily’s and everythingthats sweet in this world and rainbows and sunny days and happy songs and silly smiles", which I really love and 
                is exactly what I feel when Im close to you and when we hug. I wasnt really planning on telling you that "I love you" when we hugged, idk I didnt 
                know if it was the right time to say it or if something else was gonna happen but when we hugged I just felt an inmense amount of happines and of 
                love that I felt like it was the <em>only</em> right thing to say. I really love you, you are my everything and I really hope that we grow up together and 
                share many more moments like these, you are everything to me and I can't picture it any other way. "My love for you spreads out to the farthest stars in 
                the universe <em class='emoji'>✨🌟</em> you shine brightly like one too in my heart <em class='emoji'>❤️</em> I will never stop telling you how much you mean to me and how much I love youuuuuu". 
                You always have me feeling special, like Im at the top of the world whenever Im with you, whenever I talk to you.</li>
