            <p>I made this little website to display the results from the data analysis I did and just a couple more things that I thought of hehe</p>
            <p>Its almost been a whole year since we started talking! Since you know Im all about that data analysis I was wondering what I could find
                using this kind of analysis on the messages we have sent to each other since the start of March.</p>
            <p>I was able to gather all the data from iMessage 💬 (since April 19th 2018) and a small part of the data from Snapchat 👻 (December 14th, 2018)</p>
            <p>(Since I was only able to get since that date for Snapchat, I actually tried to scroll up all the way on Snapchat to see all the messages we have 
                sent to each other but the app actually crashed on me and it wouldnt open up again until I uninstalled and reinstalled Snapchat hehe so just 
                to give you an idea of the magnitude of all the messages we have sent to each other ❤️) </p>
            <p>So here are some stats that I was able to gather from the data that I got, its not much but I hope you like it. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Totals and Misc Stats</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the totals and averages that I found from the data, both of you, me, and both combined.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Total messages sent: <em>6888 texts</em> 💬 (over 287 days) and <em>2223 Snapchat messages</em> 👻 (over 41 days) <br> 
                This is really surprising hehe. If we were to text as much as we sent snap messages we would have <em>15,561 texts</em> in the 287 days. 
                We send Snapchat messages <em>2.25X</em> as much as we do texts</li>
            
            <li>Messages sent by me (Harim): <em>3540 texts</em> 💬 and <em>1172 Snapchat messages</em> 👻</li>
            
            <li>Messages sent by you (Betsy): <em>3348 texts</em> 💬 and <em>1051 Snapchat messages</em> 👻</li>

            <li>Number of images sent: 419 pictures sent by the two of us</li>
            
            <li>Day with most text messages 💬: January 28th, 2019 (389 text messages sent)<br>
            That day I had taken my exam in the morning and then we met up in the afternoon to grab lunch. We went up and down the Ave looking for somewhere 
            to eat (TBH I was just trying to stall and spend more time with you hehe 🤫🤭). We ended up going to the Korean BBQ place, you paid for the both 
            of us and then we walked back down the Ave to catch the bus for you to head home. Right before you got on the bus, we hugged and that was the day 
            we shared our first "I love you" in person 💓, I just wish that moment would have lasted a bit longer because I felt secure and wonderful in your 
            arms, even as Im typing this up I feel the same feeling as I did back then, a feeling of pure joy, of love, of care. When you got home you took a 
            nap and I went to help a friend with some CS homework (which I used as practice for if you need help with your CS homework in the coming quarters 
            hehe). After you woke up (I had missed you and was waiting for you to wake up to talk to you again hehe) you went and took Oso out for a walk. When 
            you got back we talked about the possibility of my parents coming back and the fear that I had of becoming antisocial and boring again if they did 
            come back. Im so happy to know that I have you to trust in and that youll always be there to help me. (Im just giggling like a little kid remembering 
            all of this hehehe) That night I also told you how when I look at you my mind goes blank and my heart starts racing, like when I was trying to tell 
            you about the episode that Abi hadnt watched yet and how I see my everything when I look at you. I love you so much, Betsy! After that we started 
            playing some games of battleship, which I <em>totally</em> won all of them 🤥. I sent you the song 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcJm1pOswfM">"Can't Take My Eyes Off You" by Frankie Valli</a> and you sent me 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ByIYof4mqo">"Open Arms" by Journey</a> and I sent you another song too hehe 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWkQbrfSvfs">"Para tu Amor" by Juanes</a> (I love how we get deep into this loving feeling️️️ ❤️)
            Hehe we then talked about the amazing moment we shared with the hug and I compared it to when you said that you would like to wrap me in a "gazillion 
            red hearts and ily’s and everythingthats sweet in this world and rainbows and sunny days and happy songs and silly smiles", which I really love and 
            is exactly what I feel when Im close to you and when we hug. I wasnt really planning on telling you that "I love you" when we hugged, idk I didnt 
            know if it was the right time to say it or if something else was gonna happen but when we hugged I just felt an inmense amount of happines and of 
            love that I felt like it was the <em>only</em> right thing to say. I really love you, you are my everything and I really hope that we grow up together and 
            share many more moments like these, you are everything to me and I can't picture it any other way. "My love for you spreads out to the farthest stars in 
            the universe ✨🌟 you shine brightly like one too in my heart ❤️ I will never stop telling you how much you mean to me and how much I love youuuuuu". 
            You always have me feeling special, like Im at the top of the world whenever Im with you, whenever I talk to you.</li>

            "You are so amazing, Betsy, and I value you and our connection so much! You are so sweet, so attentive, and so supportive. Whenever you tell me about 
            all the blessings that have been coming to you and see you smile and get excited, I cant help but do the same. I am sure that you will achieve such 
            great things (some that you are achieving even now) and I am so glad to be part of your amazing story. You will get that scholarship, and many more 
            after that one! You will get that internship and many more opportunities! You will get a new job whose hours fit your needs better! You will get into 
            the school you are thinking of transferring into! You will graduate and make everyone so proud of you and your achievements! You keep on amazing me 
            with how much youve done and how much youre doing for your future! Like you came right back to Seattle and went straight to two jobs, then two jobs 
            and school, and now a job and more school with harder classes! And with all that youre still active in church, leading your own venta group! You work 
            so hard and I am very happy to see that the fruits of your labor are starting to show ❤️ you deserve the best, Betsy ❤️ I may not be able to get an 
            internship due to my status but if I am able to help you so that you get one, that would fill me with joy, Itd feel like if I got it too. If you 
            need help in anything, I will find a way to provide that help. I am so excited for what the future holds for you and wanna see how high you can soar! 
            Con la ayuda de Dios, you can achieve everything you want. I am so proud of you! You make me so happy! You are the best! Youve got this! 💘" </li>
